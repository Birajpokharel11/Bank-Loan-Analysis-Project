- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Use Power BI to create interactive dashboards that allow stakeholders to easily interpret data and make informed decisions.
- 💡 **Insight Generation**: Provide actionable insights based on data analysis to optimize loan management, reduce financial risk, and improve customer satisfaction.

## 🛠️ **Tools & Technologies Used**
- 🗄️ **MS SQL Server**: Database management, data storage, and execution of SQL queries to extract and analyze loan-related data.
- 📊 **Power BI**: Creating visualizations and interactive dashboards to present the analyzed data in a clear and user-friendly manner.
- 📑 **Excel**: Preliminary data cleaning, exploration, and generating pivot tables and charts for quick insights.

## 📂 **Dataset Overview**
The dataset used in this project consists of various attributes related to loan applications, borrower demographics, loan status, and financial metrics. Below are some key dataset headers:

- 🆔 `Loan_ID`: Unique identifier for each loan application.
- 👤 `Gender`: Gender of the borrower.
- 💍 `Married`: Marital status of the borrower.
- 👶 `Dependents`: Number of dependents the borrower has.
- 🎓 `Education`: Educational background of the borrower.
- 💼 `Self_Employed`: Employment status of the borrower.
- 💵 `ApplicantIncome`: Income of the borrower.
- 💰 `CoapplicantIncome`: Income of the co-borrower, if any.
- 💸 `LoanAmount`: The amount of loan requested by the borrower.

## 📈 **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
The project focuses on several key KPIs that are crucial for understanding the performance and risk associated with the loan portfolio:

- 📅 **Total Loan Applications**: The total number of loan applications received, analyzed with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) tracking to observe trends over time.
- 💵 **Total Funded Amount**: The total amount disbursed as loans. This KPI is critical for understanding the scale of lending operations, with MTD and MoM comparisons to identify fluctuations.
- 💰 **Total Amount Received**: The total repayments made by borrowers. This KPI helps in assessing the cash flow and financial health of the loan portfolio.
- 📉 **Average Interest Rate**: The average interest rate applied across all loans, monitored for Month-over-Month variations to understand changes in lending costs.
- 📊 **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: This KPI measures the financial health of borrowers by comparing their debt obligations to their income, with a focus on MoM changes.
